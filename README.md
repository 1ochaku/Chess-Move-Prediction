# Chess-Move-Prediction
This project explores machine learning approaches to predict chess moves using real-game data from the Lichess.org dataset. Built as part of a course project by a team of three, the system decomposes the task into sub-problems handled by multiple models.

## Problem Breakdown
To simplify the complex task of move prediction, we trained 7 separate models:
- 1 model for piece selection
- 6 models for move prediction, one per piece type (pawn, rook, bishop, knight, queen, king)
